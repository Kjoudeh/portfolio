      I’m a dedicated Product Manager and Full Stack Developer with a passion for owning products from the ground up. 
      As a proud Liverpool fan ⚽, gym enthusiast 🏋️, and avid reader 📚, I bring a balanced approach to both my work and life. 
      I believe that truly understanding a product means diving deep into every aspect—from the technical codebase to its unique value proposition. 
      I thrive on the challenge of improving a product continuously, identifying opportunities for innovation, and ensuring its evolution with each release. 
      My process often includes creating thorough documentation, as I believe it’s an invaluable learning experience—for both myself and others—while contributing to a more collaborative, transparent environment. 
      Known for my work ethic and my ability to focus deeply when in the zone, I’m committed to bringing energy, insights, and a relentless drive to every project I lead. 
      Let’s create something extraordinary together.
